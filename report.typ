= Thoughts about unit testing

I'm not sure what should be include in this part, so I'll just say something random. 

In my opinion, unit testing is an important and useful tool for developers to find out bugs in their programs. It helps saving time and enhance the robustness. It is widely used in IT companies, and I think it is benefitial for every developer to master this skill.
